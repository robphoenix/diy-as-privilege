            Disabilities can be visible and invisible. Physical barriers and
            lack of understanding can exclude people, think about how you can
            help remove barriers.

            Do It Yourself can mean different things to different people and is
            a misleading term &mdash; it can mean you still work with people
            that record your music, people that make and sell your records,
            people that own the buildings you rehearse in, people that put on
            gigs, just as much as music facilitators, support workers or
            transport to and from a gig.
