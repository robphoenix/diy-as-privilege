        On the 4th December 2006 I saw the bands Beat Express and Heavy Load
        play in Brighton. It was the first time I had seen musicians with
        learning disabilities on stage performing and it was one of the best
        gigs I’ve ever been to. I wondered why I hadn’t heard of or seen these
        musicians play before. I thought that if I had enjoyed it so much, then
        other people would too. It also made me realise the opportunities I had
        as a musician weren’t available to everyone. So, since then I’ve done
        all I can to support all kinds of people to make all kinds of music,
        share this music and get others to watch and listen.

        This includes supporting the creation of a music scene in Brighton
        around the long running Rock House (link:
        https://therockhousebrighton.blogspot.com/) night; organising three UK
        tours for bands with members with learning disabilities through Constant
        Flux (link: www.constantflux.co.uk) ; supporting DIY Space For London
        (link: https://diyspaceforlondon.org/) to be the first volunteer run
        venue in the UK to achieve Bronze accreditation for access; and working
        for organisations such as Heart n Soul (https://www.heartnsoul.co.uk/),
        Carousel (http://www.carousel.org.uk/), Club Soda
        (http://www.clubsoda.org.uk/), Culture Shift (link:
        https://www.cultureshift.org.uk/) and Stay Up Late
        (https://stayuplate.org/) as a music facilitator supporting people with
        learning disabilities to form bands, create music, record and perform;
        as well as organising countless other gigs, releases, events and
        projects.

        I think everyone should have the chance to experience a little of what
        I’ve been lucky enough to experience since 2006. I will forever be
        grateful for everything I have learnt from being involved with all of
        this. I wrote the manifesto to try and encourage others to get involved
        and help make more and more things happen.

        <br />
        In 2006 I only knew two bands existed, now I can write the list below of
        bands and musicians. Some existed for just one night and some have been
        playing for years, all of them helped change mine and other people’s
        worlds, even in some small way. I hope this list will only get longer
        and longer!  -{" "}
