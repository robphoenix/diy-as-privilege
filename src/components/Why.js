        On the 4th December 2006 I saw the bands <Italic>Beat Express</Italic>{" "}
        and <Italic>Heavy Load</Italic> play in Brighton. It was the first time
        I had seen musicians with learning disabilities on stage performing and
        it was one of the best gigs I’ve ever been to. I wondered why I hadn’t
        heard of or seen these musicians play before. I thought that if I had
        enjoyed it so much, then other people would too. It also made me realise
        the opportunities I had as a musician weren’t available to everyone. So,
        since then I’ve done all I can to support all kinds of people to make
        all kinds of music, share this music and get others to watch and listen.

        This includes supporting the creation of a music scene in Brighton

        I think everyone should have the chance to experience a little of what
        I’ve been lucky enough to experience since 2006. I will forever be
        grateful for everything I have learnt from being involved with all of
        this. I wrote the manifesto to try and encourage others to get involved
        and help make more and more things happen.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2006 I only knew two bands existed, now I can write the list below of
        bands and musicians. Some existed for just one night and some have been
        playing for years, all of them helped change mine and other people’s
        worlds, even in some small way. I hope this list will only get longer
        and longer!
